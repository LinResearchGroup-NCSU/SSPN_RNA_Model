No effort was made to rotate the repositioned residues properly, since it makes little difference to the coarse-grained PDB. The only possible difference is in the native pairing; more on this later.\n",

Because the phosphorus atom is the heaviest single atom and close to the center of the RNA residue's negative charge density, it makes a good location for the interaction site. However, this means that each system will end up being one nucleotide shorter than in reality; thus the 22-nt hairpin is 21-nt in simulation. This does not appear to make a profound impact on the free-energy landscape, and will make even less of an impact for larger systems.\n",

    "OpenABC is GPU-accelerated [50], so we expect the user to use GPU. We have added two options for additional potentials which can be used to probe the unfolding kinetics and dynamics: constant force and constant velocity. In both cases, one can imagine the end beads of the system being held in optical traps such as used in [45]. Constant force is effectively biasing the system toward the unfolded state [17] and is used to generate free energy diagrams to observe the transition force, and to determine $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta G$. Constant velocity pulls the optical traps apart, ripping the molecule, and can be used to reveal sequential unfolding events [45]. To achieve this, the code increments the equilibrium length between the optical traps every timestep, shifting the traps at a constant velocity, hence the name. To achieve a nice rupturing plot, we recommend a using simulation time of 20 ns for a velocity of 3.0 nm/ns (keeping the optical trap force constant $k$ at 1.4 pN/nm. Ultimately, only the loading rate $v\\cdot k$ matters, so the choice of 1.4 is somewhat arbitrary). This will run relatively quickly and show a distinct rupture event for any of the systems. "
